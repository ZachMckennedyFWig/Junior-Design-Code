Program Structure Experimentation

Subsystem Rules
    1. Subsystems must be non-blocking 
    2. Subsystems have an update method that can be called as much as desired without breaking stuff
    3. Subsystems have a begin method to initialize them at startup
    4. Subsystems have an action method to start their action cycle 

Main loop
    1. Update all subsystems (use the inherited looping method to make it easy)

    2. Handle flags and such that should be delt with no matter the state

    3. Switch Case for states
        A. Idle
            If another cycle is due 
                -> Initiate movement
                -> Set state to Moving
        B. Moving
            If movement complete
                -> Initiate Action
                -> Set state to Acting
        C. Acting
            If action complete
                -> Set state to Idle
        D. Error

Error handling
    There is a global enum type that contains every error code
